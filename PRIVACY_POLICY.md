This privacy policy describes how the Chicago Bikeshare Alexa
skill ("the skill") collects and uses personal information.

# What we store

The only personal information stored by the skill is user-provided
addresses. You may use the skill without providing an address,
in which case we store no information about you. If you choose
to store an address, it will be connected with a unique, randomly-generated ID.
The skill recognizes you only through this unique ID.

# When we store it

If you choose to provide an address (for example, by saying
"Echo, tell Chicago Bikeshare to add my origin address.", or
"Echo, tell Chicago Bikeshare to add my destination address."),
you will be guided through a dialog
to input address information. At the conclusion of the dialog,
you will be asked to confirm the address. If you do not confirm
the address, no information will be stored.

# How we use personal information

Addresses provided to the skill will be used only to inform users
about the status of Divvy stations near that address.
Your personal information will not be made available to any third party
for any purpose.

# How we store personal information

Personal information you provide will be stored in
resources provided by Amazon Web Services.

# How you can control your information

You may ask what, if any, address the skill has stored for you
by asking "Echo, tell me what origin address is stored" or
"Echo, tell me what destination address is stored".
At any time, you may request that we remove your information by
saying "Echo, delete my addresses". If you request that the
skill delete your address information and confirm the request,
the skill will retain no record of your personal information.
